SemanticFormsSelect MediaWiki Extension
===================

see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SemanticFormsSelect

Original code from https://code.google.com/p/semanticformsselect/downloads/list

## Candidate 1.2 version

This is an update to make it work with newer MediaWiki versions.

For instance, since AJAX methods are deprecated in newer MediaWiki versions, they have been updated to API ones.

It can still be considered a preliminary alpha versions. Use with caution.

## TODO

* Check how it works in different multiple template circumstances
* Check whether it works with extra Semantic Forms options, such as mapping template.
