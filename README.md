# SemanticFormsSelect MediaWiki Extension

see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SemanticFormsSelect for more information and examples.

Original code from https://code.google.com/p/semanticformsselect/downloads/list

## Candidate 1.2 version

This is an update to make it work with newer MediaWiki versions.

For instance, since AJAX methods are deprecated in newer MediaWiki versions, they have been updated to API ones.

It can still be considered a preliminary alpha version. Use with caution.

## TODO

* Allowing other options existing in Semantic Forms, especially "mapping template" parameter.
